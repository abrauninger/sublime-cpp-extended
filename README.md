# sublime-cpp-extended
Improved C++ syntax highlighting in Sublime Text, with two color schemes included.

## C++ Extended
`C++ Extended.sublime-syntax` extends the `C++.sublime-syntax` that is included in Sublime Text 3.  `C++ Extended` includes many small improvements that enable more useful syntax highlighting.

Also included are two color schemes that take full advantage of the `C++ Extended` syntax:

## Calypso
A dark color scheme.

## Telluride
A light color scheme.
