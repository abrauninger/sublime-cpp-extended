# sublime-cpp-extended
Improved C++ syntax highlighting in Sublime Text, with two color schemes included.

## C++ Extended
`C++ Extended.sublime-syntax` extends the `C++.sublime-syntax` that is included in Sublime Text 3.  `C++ Extended` includes many small improvements that enable more useful syntax highlighting.

Also included are two color schemes that take full advantage of the `C++ Extended` syntax:

## Calypso
A dark color scheme.

## Telluride
A light color scheme.

## Install
Within Sublime Text, go to **Preferences** > **Browse Packages...** to view the package directory.

In a terminal/command prompt, change to the package directory and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/abrauninger/sublime-cpp-extended.git "C++ Extended"
```
After installing, you should be able to choose **View** > **Syntax** > **C++ Extended** and **Preferences** > **Color Scheme...** > **Calypso** or **Telluride**.
